# Machine Learning Experiment 1

## Aim
To understand basic Machine Learning concepts and statistical measures using Python in Google Colab.

## Tools Used
- Google Colab  
- Python  
- NumPy, Pandas  
- Matplotlib, Scikit-learn

## Description
This experiment demonstrates basic Machine Learning workflow and fundamental statistical concepts used in data analysis.

## Statistical Definitions & Formulas

**Mean** – Average of all values  
Mean = (Σx) / n  

**Median** – Middle value of ordered data  

**Mode** – Most frequently occurring value  

**Variance** – Measure of data spread  
Variance = Σ(x − μ)² / n  

**Standard Deviation** – Square root of variance  
Standard Deviation = √Variance  

## Execution
Upload the notebook to Google Colab and run all cells.

## Result
The experiment executed successfully and produced the expected results.
